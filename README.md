# BinaryMagicCards

A mini program to construct the binary magic cards. The magic trick is as follows:
Ask a person to pick a (one and only one) number in a pre-defined range starting from zero, e.g. 0-7, 0-31, 0-63. The number can include zero, but negative numbers are not allowed.
Then, tell the person to select all (or none of) the cards that contain his/her number in mind. The 'magician' can then identify the person picked number in mind based on the selected cards.

The problem to solve is as follows:
How to construct the cards and fill them with those numbers in the given range such that they cover every possible number that can be chosen by the asked person in the pre-defined range?

The program solves the problem above. A detailed writeup (to be published in pdf) on how to solve the problem using binary numbers is under construction.
