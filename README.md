# BinaryMagicCards

The 'magic' trick is as follows:
The magician ask a person to pick a (one and only one) number in a range starting from 0, e.g. 0-7, 0-31, 0-63. The number can include zero, but negative numbers are not allowed. The person cannot tell the magician his/her picked number.

Then, the magician tell the person to select all (or none of) the cards that contain his/her number in mind. The magician can then identify the person picked number in mind based on the selected cards.

The problem to solve is as follows:
How to construct the cards and fill them with those numbers in the given range such that they cover every possible number that can be chosen by the asked person in the pre-defined range?

The program 'BinaryMagicInv.py' solves the problem above. The secpmd program 'BinaryMagic.py' is a slight modficiation to the first program. It asks the user how many binary magic cards the user wants to construct. See 'binary_magic_card.pdf' on how to solve the problem using the binary number system.
