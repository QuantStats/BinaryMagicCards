# BinaryMagicCards

A mini program to construct the binary magic cards. The magic trick is as follows:
Think of a number in a given pre-defined range. The number can include zero, but negative numbers are not allowed. 
Then, circle the cards that contain your number in mind.

The problem to solve is as follows:
How to construct the cards and filled them with those numbers in the given range such that it covers every possible number in the pre-defined range?

The program solves the problem above. A detailed writeup (to be published in pdf) on how to solve the problem using binary numbers is under construction.
